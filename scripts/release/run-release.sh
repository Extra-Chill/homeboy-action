# Env vars:
#   RELEASE_BRANCH      - branch to release from (default: main)
#   COMPONENT_NAME      - component ID override
#   RELEASE_DRY_RUN     - if "true", preview without making changes
#   RELEASE_HEAD        - if "true", finish release at existing HEAD/tag
#   RELEASE_FROM_ARTIFACTS - artifact directory passed to --from-artifacts
#
# Outputs (GITHUB_OUTPUT):
#   released:        true|false
#   release-version: the version (e.g. 0.63.0)
#   release-tag:     the git tag (e.g. v0.63.0)
#   release-bump-type: patch|minor|major
#   skipped-reason:  why release was skipped (if released=false)

# Identify the branch HEAD is on.
#
# `git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` returns the LITERAL STRING "HEAD" on a
# detached checkout, and `actions/checkout` detaches whenever it is given
# `ref: <sha>` — the ordinary way a workflow pins every job to the commit that
# triggered it. The guard below compared that literal against RELEASE_BRANCH,
# concluded "not on main" for a commit that WAS main's tip, and exited 0 without
# ever invoking `homeboy release`. No release-version was written, and the
# calling workflow read that emptiness as "nothing to release" — green run,
# every job skipped, 131 commits unreleased (Extra-Chill/homeboy#10703).
#
# When HEAD is detached, identify the branch by COMMIT IDENTITY instead. That is
# also the property this guard actually cares about: not the name HEAD is
# reachable under, but whether the commit being released is the release branch.
#
# This is deliberately NOT solved by RELEASE_HEAD. That variable also appends
# `--head`, which tells homeboy to finish an already-versioned, already-tagged
# HEAD and to skip version and changelog computation entirely. It answers "what
# kind of release is this", not "where am I allowed to release from"; using it
# to silence a branch check would skip the very work a dry run exists to do.

# Tip-sync handled in core: `homeboy release` runs `validate_remote_sync`
# which fetches and fast-forwards from origin before the working-tree check,
# and `get_uncommitted_changes` runs `git update-index --refresh` so any
# stale stat info (from prior cargo build / extension setup steps) does not
# surface as a false-positive dirty tree. The wrapper used to do its own
# `git pull --ff-only` here as a workaround, which was the original symptom
# of the upstream gap fixed in homeboy core. See homeboy PR #2368.

# Quality gates run in separate jobs before this script, so --skip-checks
# is always safe here. The publish and github.release flags are
# configurable: downstream consumers that wire up extensions like
# homeboy-extensions/wordpress (release.package + release.publish) want
# the full pipeline by default. Components that publish artifacts or
# create GitHub Releases outside the homeboy pipeline (binary cross-
# compile, hand-rolled gh release create, …) opt out via the action
# inputs that set these env vars.
