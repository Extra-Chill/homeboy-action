"""Strict command supervisor with platform-specific descendant containment.

Two backends, because the kernel primitives that make containment provable are
not portable:

`linux` — `PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER` reparents every orphaned descendant onto the
supervisor, `/proc` walks the resulting tree, and pidfds signal it without a
PID-reuse window. This is the strongest guarantee available and stays the
default on Linux runners.

`posix` — Darwin (and any other POSIX host) has no subreaper and no pidfd, so
the same guarantee cannot be reconstructed from the process table alone: a
descendant that double-forks and calls `setsid` leaves both the process group
and the parent chain with no portable trace. The portable backend therefore
splits the two jobs the Linux backend fuses:

  * *Termination* uses the command's own session/process group (`killpg`) plus
    the transitive parent chain, which covers every descendant that did not
    deliberately detach.
  * *Proof* uses an inherited pipe. The command is spawned holding the write end
    of a pipe the supervisor keeps the read end of, and every descendant
    inherits that descriptor across `fork` and `exec`. EOF on the read end is
    positive evidence that no descendant is left holding it — including one that
    detached itself out of reach of `killpg`. No EOF inside the cleanup budget is
    reported as a containment failure (exit 125) rather than laundered into a
    pass.

The pipe is evidence, not a leash: the supervisor cannot signal a descendant it
cannot name. What it can do is refuse to certify a command whose descendants
outlived it, which is the property strict mode exists to protect.

`HOMEBOY_ACTION_CONTAINMENT_BACKEND` selects the backend explicitly. The default
is `auto`, which picks by platform; naming `posix` is how the portable backend
stays under test on Linux runners instead of only on the macOS ones that depend
on it.
